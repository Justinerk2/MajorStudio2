#Leadership Gender Gap

#####While 92% of girls believe anyone can acquire the skills of leadership, only 21% believe they currently have most of the key qualities required to be a good leader (Schoenberg, Salmond, Fleshman 2008, 14).

#####Political leadership determines the public policy of a country. Diverse political leadership ensures accurate representation of the population. In the United States, a gender gap exists in political leadership. Although, women gained the right to vote 97 years ago, in federal and state politics, women hold less than 20% of seats in congress (Pew Research Center 2015).
#####Girls and women are often not viewed in society as strong leaders, not only by boys and men, but equally by women themselves. Society needs to become aware of these false perceptions of women leaders, and their negative impact on political representation. 
#####This visualization contrasts the perspectives of women, men, boys and girls, to the number of men and women in various political entities. Comparing these four viewpoints allows for a more comprehensive look at how gender and age affect the relation between the perceptions of women leaders and the reality of the number of women political leaders.  
#####This paper also explores the process and methodology used to collect data, analyze the data, and visually communicate the data through the visualization. This analysis also includes Iterations and user testing.
